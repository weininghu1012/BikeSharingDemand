Report writing guidelines
Section 1 summary/abstract: this section includes the goals of your project and the main conclusions.
Section 2: describe your variables and include summary statistics and frequency tables (the latter for categorical variables), and some scatterplots.
Next sections: outline of analyses to support your main conclusions.
Appendix: R code and secondary plots (only most important plots are needed in the main part of the report).
Label tables and graphs so that they can be understood without referring to the text in the report.
Units of variables (where appropriate) should be included in tables and in the writing.
In the main body of the report (not including Appendix), do not use too many (significant) digits. 
Sample means and SDs: one more digit beyond the raw data is enough.
